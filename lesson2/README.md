#### Running a basic server.

This guide will help you run the examples

> TIP:  When typing out a file name, you can use the `tab` key in the terminal to spell out the rest of the file name for you.

Open the terminal in your IDE or computer.  If you happen to be on lesson1 make sure to enter the `lesson2` folder.

```sh
$ cd ..
```

```sh
$ cd lesson2
```

Now lets test out the JS programs.

```sh
$ node server.js
```

On your browser visit `http://localhost:3005/index.html`

## Assignment

Update the `server.js` to now allow me to visit `http://localhost:3005/todo.html` and display the page.
