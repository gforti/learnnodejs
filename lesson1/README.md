> TIP:  When typing out a file name, you can use the `tab` key in the terminal to spell out the rest of the file name for you.

```sh
$ cd lesson1
```

Now lets test out the JS programs.  They both will give the same result.

```sh
$ node main.js
```

> Note that after you type `node main-` you can use the `tab` key to spell out the rest.

```sh
$ node main-anonymous-function.js
```

## Assignment
