## JWT Demo

JWT, JSON Web tokens, is a token that is generated by the server so you are able to have access to a rest API allowing the rest api to stay stateless (No need for sessions to keep track of a user)

The idea is that a web token is consisted of three parts.

- Header = A JSON with the type of token and the hash Algorithm used
- Payload = JSON information that you can extract, most importantly when the token expires
- Signature = A hash combination of the header + payload + a secret key
### Creating a .env file

You can create a empty file with the extention `.env`.  environment variables are stored only on the machine they are set on.
In this case we are loading a file that has a key=value pair.  Database connections etc. are normally stored this way.

```sh
JWT_SECRET=thisIsASecretString
```

Use and install the module `dotenv`

```sh
$ npm install dotenv --save
```
in your app you must load any .env files that it will find.

```js
require('dotenv').load();
```

Doing this will add the variables to the process.env object.

```js
process.env.JWT_SECRET
```

### Run the demo

So to run the demo you will need to use the command (after installing all the packages)

```sh
$ npm start
```

Once that is done, on the root folder there is an index.html page.  Run that in your browser.

> Note that if you use netbeans, running a webpage file allows you to run it in netbeans internal server so you can make the rest calls with no problems.
